            <h1>The  Rule of Thirds</h1>
            <p>Good composition often results in good photographs, even of the most mundane subjects. There are several rules of thumb with respect to employing good composition. One of the most used is the Rule of Thirds. The Rule of Thirds is based on the observation that compositions in which the topic of interest is placed directly in the center of the frame tend to be static and uninteresting.</p><p>A better approach is to imagine a grid drawn over your photograph that divides it into thirds, like a tic-tac-toe grid. Place your point of interest away from the center of the frame and onto one of the intersection points on the grid (see below).</p>

            <p>If you place points of interest into the thirds, your photo 
                becomes more balanced and will enable the viewer to interact with 
                it more naturally. Studies have shown that people's eyes are usually 
                drawn to the location of the the intersection points 
                in the grid rather than the center of the frame. The Rule of 
                Thirds works with this natural way of viewing an image rather than 
                against it. Many digital cameras allow the user to display the grid 
                on the preview screen, making it easier to employ the Rule of Thirds 
                directly before the shot is taken.
